# Phishing Detection System 🚨

**Repository:** [phishing-detection](https://github.com/Tech-Anshika/phishing-detection)  
**Stage:** 1 – Submission Ready  

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Phishing Detection System** is an AI-powered platform designed to detect phishing domains targeting **Critical Sector Entities (CSEs)**. It provides both single-domain prediction and bulk-domain processing through a **FastAPI** interface, allowing researchers and cybersecurity teams to submit domains for automated analysis.  

This project is part of a hackathon Stage-1 submission and is focused on rapid, accurate, and reliable domain threat classification.

## 2. Problem Statement

CSEs face an increasing number of phishing attacks, where malicious actors create fraudulent websites to steal sensitive information. Manual detection is time-consuming and error-prone.  

**Solution Approach:**  
- Automate phishing detection using a machine learning model trained on domain features.  
- Provide bulk and single-domain prediction capabilities.  
- Generate submission-ready CSV files for Stage-1 evaluation.

## 3. Features

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Health check: returns a simple message confirming API is running. |
| `/predict/` | GET | Predicts if a single domain is phishing or legitimate. |
| `/bulk_predict/` | POST | Accepts a CSV file with multiple domains and returns a CSV with predictions for Stage-1 submission. |

### Domain Features Used

- Domain age (`domain_age_days`)  
- Trusted registrar (`trusted_registrar`)  
- Presence of MX records (`has_mx`)  
- Presence of NS records (`has_ns`)  
- WHOIS completeness (`whois_complete`)  
- SSL validity (`has_ssl`, `ssl_valid_days`, `is_ssl_short`)  
- IP address, subnet, and IDN status  

> Note: For Stage-1 submission, only features used in model training are included in predictions.
